# The influence of Toronto's 2020 short-term rental market regulations on its AirBnB market.

__This repository belongs to our research into the effect of Toronto's operation to recover the housing market by implementing a new set of regulations on September 10, 2020. This research is performed as a part of the [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com) course at Tilburg University. In this research we answer the following research question:__

In what way did the implemented regulations influence the prices of the listings on AirBnB in Toronto? 

## Motivation

As stated above, the city of Toronto implemented some new rules for the short term rental market, which also affects AirBnB operators. The new rules imply the following:
- You have to register your AirBnB unit at the City of Toronto. After you have registered, you have to pay a $50 renewal fee per year. 
- The registered AirBnB owners have to pay a Municipal Accommodation Tax of 4% on a quarterly basis. 
- You will not be able to list properties on AirBnB if it is not your primary residence. This means that you can only AirBnB your home, whether that is a part of it or all of it. 

Especially the last rule shakes up a lot among the AirBnB community, as it means that a lot of people cannot list their investement units on AirBnB anymore. A lot of income for many residents of Toronto will be lost. But why would the City of Toronto implement such a rule? Well, Toronto decided to implement such rules, because the housing market in Toronto kept getting more expensive. Especially the prices for long-term rental housing were becoming sky-high. Buying or renting a nice place in Toronto became more difficult by the minute, and many people started complaining.
With implementation of these rules, the so-called "ghost hotels" (properties which are owned by a landlord who owns a lot of units, but who does not actually live there) are bound to disappear, which will free a lot of properties and hopefully, improve the affordability and availability of housing. 

However, after the implementation of these rules, fewer listings will probably be available on AirBnB. Will this drive up the prices of the listings in Toronto? It is possible that will not happen, because the listings on AirBnB will only be primary listings: people are renting their own house, so no large extra investments are needed. No large investments also mean that nothing large has to be earned back by renting it out. If yes, this might have its influence on the tourism market. However, the decrease in supply can also lead to a price increase. A price increase can affect the tourist market. When AirBnB prices are higher, tourists are less likely to choose Toronto as their destination; other cities might be cheaper. With lesser toursists coming to Toronto, not only the Toronto AirBnB market will be affected, but the city will be affected in many ways. Restaurants, entertainment, public transportation, everything will suffer if lesser toursists are drawn to the city.
That is why it is important that the effects of these regulations are examined. If the prices are higher and tourism will be affected, the City of Toronto can anticipate and make sure Toronto will be an attractive city for tourists nevertheless!
